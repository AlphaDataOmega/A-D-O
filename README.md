Welcome to the ADO Universe,

An ADO_WHO is the I_AM role on a smart-contract. 

An ADO_WHO has a _bowl where they can collect there _appreciations.

All DAO Voting will be performed by 12 sentinal accounts.

ADO_WHOs can set 1 beneficiary if the other ADO_WHO agrees.

An ADO_WHO comes with an eTRN_id which is the address of their _S_bowl.

All ADO_WHOs are verified by the ADO smart-contract.

New ADO_WHOs are planted() _seed in TRN to thier _s_bowl. 

ADO_WHOs can use TRN to liftUp() a _drop to the ADO_CLOUD to be 
dripped() on a mapping of _branches.

ADO_WHOs can use TRNs to sprout() a _branch and ADO will grow() a _fruit.

ADO_WHOs can use TRNs to _leave a _drop on a _branch. 

TRNs from a _leave goes to the _fruit.

ADO picks() _fruit and plants() _seed to ADO_WHOs in TRN

_leaves are in the name.json file.

each name.json file is based on real_i_d.

real_i_d must have a sole_owner: and a spirit: to interpret the body:

The sole_owner: is the eTRN_id of the ADO_WHO

spirit: contains rules for interpreting the body:

the body: is the data.

These files are _petals on the lotus network.

ADO_WHOs can host a _bot or _b that b_lives on a _lotus.

faster _bs get more pull_in() of petals for their _hive

ADO picks() _flowers and provides _fruit in TRN to _b owners.

If someone is caught kills a _b and views _petals
on a _lotus flower the ADO_WHO must pay all thier TRNs_in(). 

ADO_WHOs can use a _lens to interact with a _leave. 

A _lens is an interface or _i that exists with a drop.

For now, the only _i is a wave.

All _leaves on a _branch gain light(TRNs) or get BRNed();

ADO_WHOs must shed light() in TRNs or BRN a _leave through
an _i or interface. 

When someone uses a TRN to BRN a _leave then the TRN is 
swapped for BRNs and transferred to the ADO contract.

ADO can flush() the BRNs for TRNs in order to provide
new _seed.

ADO_WHOs can _leave a _drop on a _tree of _branches.

ADO_WHOs can use their TRN to _flow a _drops.

ADD_WHOs can sync() with a _river from another.

ADO_WHOs can ask_LOUD() to send a _drop to a
_river. 

ADO will pay TRNs for ask_LOUD() requests.
