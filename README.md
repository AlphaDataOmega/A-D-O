Welcome to the ADO Universe.

An ADOWHO is the sole owner of an ADO NFT Token.

An ADOWHO has a wallet where they can collect TRNs.

TRNs are what make the ADO Universe go 'round.

TRNs are used to make drops.

Drops contain the data sent to the ADO Tree.

Drops are used to create leaves on the branches of the ADO Tree.

Leaves are short form social content stored within adoTree.earth.

Branches are the directory locations of leaves. 

Leaves can have directories of their own called stems. 

As ADOWHOs travers the ADO Universe they must contribute. 

ADOWHOs must occasionally consider, or shed light upon leaves.

When prompted to shed light, ADOWHOs can appreciate or burn a leave.

In order to shed light or burn a leave it will cost TRNs.

Appreciated leaves send TRNs to their owner. 

Burned leaves cause ADO to swap a TRN for a BRN Token.

Leaves can be burned off a branch.

Each Branch has a Fruit. 

Fruits grow from the light gained by the leaves on thier branch.

Fruits produce seeds and neckTRN when harvested.

Seeds are distributed to new ADOWHOs. 

NeckTRN is distributed to the brightest leaves on a branch.

The ADO Contract can wash BRNs away from an ADOWHO.

ADOWHOs are washed by swapping BRN Tokens for TRN.
